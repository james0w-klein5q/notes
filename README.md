- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By giving priority to the critical tasks first, you can ensure that your project stays on track and meets its deadlines. Use a task management tool, such as Trello or Asana, to help keep track of your tasks and their priorities. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning is crucial for any project. When starting a new project or working with a team, make sure to plan out the entire process, including the deadlines, milestones, resources, etc. Planning ahead will prevent last-minute surprises and help ensure a smooth project completion.  
3. Stay organized: As a programmer, maintaining a clean and organized codebase is vital. Organizing your code will make it easier to find and fix errors, add new features, or maintain the code in the future. Follow coding conventions and use version control systems, like Git, regularly to keep your work in order. Additionally, using code editors with intelligent code completion and auto-formatting tools can save time and reduce the risk of errors.
